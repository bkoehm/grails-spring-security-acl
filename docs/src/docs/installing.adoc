[[Installing]]
== Installing

Add an entry in the dependencies block of your `build.gradle file, changing the version as needed:

[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
   ...
   compile 'org.grails.plugins:spring-security-acl:{projectVersion}'
   ...
----

Different Branches are built for different versions of Grails

* master: Grails 4
* 3.3.x: Grails 3.3+
* grails_32: Grails 3.2
* 2.x: Grails 2


Current version (master) is for Grails 4 only.
Previous version (3.3.x) is only compatible with Grails 3.3.x or higher.

For previous Grails 3 versions ( 3.0.x, 3.1.x and 3.2.x ) use:

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
   ...
   compile 'org.grails.plugins:spring-security-acl:3.1.1'
   ...
----
