=== Snapshots

Snapshots are published automatically to https://repo.grails.org/ui/native/core/org/grails/plugins/spring-security-acl/[repo.grails.org] on every successful build.
You can use them by defining this Maven repository inside
the `repositories` block in your `build.gradle`:

[source, groovy]
----
maven { url "https://repo.grails.org/grails/core" }
